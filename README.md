You can check your NSDA Tournament, Pairings, and Results on mobile!The app scrapes Tabroom.com( A project of the National Speech and Debate
Association) and neatly displays all of the tournaments in the country on the mobile screen. It will automatically update to the most recent
tournaments and will save any previosuly loaded tournaments if the user has no internet connection.
